              information from contracted Credit Bureau(s) for the purpose of
              matching you to a Provider, product, or service through the
              Freedom network. This information could include, but might not be
              limited to, your credit report, credit score, and other credit
              information. Freedom may obtain a limited credit report (“soft
              pull”) regardless of whether you provide your Social Security
              Number. To help the government fight identity theft, the funding
              of terrorism and money laundering activities, and to help attempt
              to verify your identity, Freedom and its Providers may obtain,
              verify and record information that identifies each person who
              opens an account with us and Providers. Freedom and its Providers
              may ask for your name, Social Security Number, address, telephone
              number, date of birth and other important information including,
              but not limited to, information received from your credit file,
              that may allow us and Providers to properly identify you. It is
              possible that a Provider may perform a soft inquiry on your credit
              at the same time for the same or similar purposes, but the soft
              inquiry into your credit does not impact your credit score. Not
              all Providers will receive your Social Security Number and, for
              those that do, not all will perform the soft inquiry of credit.
              Freedom does not perform hard inquiries into credit, though
              certain lenders on its network will perform a hard inquiry to
              evaluate you for a firm offer of credit. From time-to-time Freedom
              is examined by state and federal regulators and as such is
              required to maintain your Personally Identifiable Information to
              adhere to certain jurisdictions’ data retention requirements. Your
              information may also be obtained from Providers after you are
              matched to adhere to state and federal reporting and record
              retention requirements. You authorize Freedom and its
              participating Providers to share such information as required.
            </p>
            <p>
              Services offered by Providers may only be made to residents of
              states where Providers are authorized to make their products
              and/or services available. A Provider’s participation in and
              offering of its products on the Websites does not constitute an
              offer by any Provider or by Freedom to provide services outside of
              their authorized jurisdictions, and to the extent you seek or
              receive information from a Provider regarding any prospective
              service which would be outside of the Providers’ authorized
              jurisdiction, that information is for informational purposes only.
              Providers shall have the right to discontinue, suspend or
              terminate the offering of any product or service in any specific
              state through the Websites at any time, without prior notice.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not guarantee acceptance into any particular program or
              specific terms or conditions with any Provider; approval standards
              are established and maintained solely by individual Providers.
              Likewise, we do not guarantee that the rates offered by Providers
              include the lowest rates available in the market or the rate that
              the Providers will ultimately charge. Providers may not offer all
              products as well as not offer products in all states. You might
              not be matched with the Provider making any specific offer.

            <p>
              Generally, widgets are tools that you may place on your website,
              which allow visitors to your website to access and view content on
              or from another website. Widgets published by Freedom (“Widgets”)
              provide access to the Websites, Content and Services from points
              outside of the Websites. Widgets may be placed on your websites,
              blogs, your pages at online social network or media sites (to the
              extent permitted by such sites), and other similar platforms.
              Freedom prohibits the placement of Widgets on websites, platforms
              or devices that contain content that is sexual, offensive,
              deceptive or illegal in nature or that in any way promotes or
              encourages hatred, violence, discrimination or illegal activities,
              or otherwise inappropriate as determined by Freedom in its sole
              discretion. You shall use the Widgets in a manner consistent with
              all applicable laws and solely for lawful purposes. You cannot use
              the Widgets for any other purpose, and nothing in this Agreement
              shall be deemed to grant you any rights, title or interest in the
              Widgets, Websites, Content or Services. Freedom reserves the right
              to remove or demand the removal of any Widget, or revoke your
              right to use any Widget, for any reason.

                change any code provided by Freedom, obscure or disable any
                element of any Widget, tag links to Freedom from the Widget with

                You must place the Widget on a page that is context-appropriate
                to the content of the Widget, and any reference to Freedom or
                its products and services must be accurate. For example, you may
                place Widgets on pages of your web site that contain a
                discussion of personal finance, mortgages or residential real
                estate.

                Additionally, you may not place the Widget on any site that
                disparages Freedom, our Services, or the products/services of
                Providers on our network, infringes any Freedom intellectual
                property or other rights, or violates any applicable law.

        *Our estimates are based on prior results, which will vary depending on
        your specific enrolled creditors and your individual program terms. Not
        all clients are able to complete their program for various reasons,
        including their ability to save sufficient funds. We do not guarantee
        that your debts will be resolved for a specific amount or percentage or
        within a specific period of time. We do not assume your debts, make
        monthly payments to creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting or
        legal advice or credit repair services. Our service is not available in
        all states, including New Jersey, and our fees may vary from state to
        state. Please contact a tax professional to discuss potential tax
        consequences of less than full balance debt resolution. Read and
        understand all program materials prior to enrollment. The use of debt
        settlement services will likely adversely affect your creditworthiness,
        may result in you being subject to collections or being sued by
        creditors or collectors and may increase the outstanding balances of
        your enrolled accounts due to the accrual of fees and interest. However,
        negotiated settlements we obtain on your behalf resolve the entire
        account, including all accrued fees and interest. C.P.D. Reg. No.

        ** This guarantee takes effect when you graduate the program—or even if
        you leave before graduating. When you exit the program, we’ll use the
        combined total of all the debts you enrolled and settled and the fees
        you paid to us to calculate your eligibility for a refund.
