          Feel overwhelmed by credit card debt? Consider pursuing credit card
          debt relief, which means paying less than you owe to have your balance
          zeroed out. There are several routes to obtain credit card debt relief
          if your debt becomes unfavorable. Just be aware that credit card debt
          relief is not a free lunch and has consequences.

          How to Get Credit Card Debt Relief
        </p>

        <p>
          The right credit card debt relief solution for you depends on your
          credit card debt, how many payments you have missed, and who owns your
          debt.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first step is to get organized if you have debts you can’t pay.
          Take some time to figure out the following:
        </p>

        <ul class="flex flex-col gap-4">
          <li class="flex gap-6">
            <div
              class="flex justify-center items-center self-center bg-primary w-6 h-6 rounded-full shrink-0"

              Whom do you owe? If you're having trouble paying off debt, chances
              are you owe money to more than one creditor. You may have
              different credit card companies, lenders, or merchants after you.
              To complicate matters more, these creditors may have passed the
              job of collecting your debt along to a collection agency or a debt
              buyer. The next section of this article will explain the
              differences in dealing with the different types of debt
              collectors. For starters, though, make a list of every
              organization that's after you for money.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">

          Seeking Debt Relief Depends on Whom You’re Dealing With
        </span>

        <p>
          Debt collectors know they can't get something when you've got nothing.
          Their goal is to get as much out of you as possible, even if it's less
          than the total amount you owe. They'd rather get partial payment than
          nothing at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s why there’s room to negotiate. However, debt collectors are
          tough adversaries. They’ve heard every excuse in the book and know how
          to drive a hard bargain.
        </p>

        <p>
          How you approach this negotiation depends on the type of organization
          pushing you. It might be:

        </ul>

        <p>
          Each type of debt collector works differently and is motivated
          uniquely. That should help guide how you deal with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sections below will explain more about these different types of
          debt collectors.
        </p>

        <p>Credit card debt relief from your credit card company.</p>

        <p>
          Unlike some collection agencies pursuing credit card debt on behalf of
          other companies, when a company is attempting to collect its own debt,
          it isn't bound by a law called the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
          (FDCPA). That law restricts how a debt collector can approach a
          consumer, but those restrictions do not apply to a credit card company
          trying to collect its own debt.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, while a credit card company may not have to abide by the
          FDCPA, they are motivated to work with you to find a reasonable
          solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          First of all, they haven't yet had to go to the expense of hiring a
          debt collection agency. If you can save them that expense with a
          compromise, original creditors may be willing to work with you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, these companies aren’t primarily in the business of collecting
          past credit card debts – they’re in the business of maintaining
          ongoing relationships with customers. If there’s a way they can handle
          your credit card debt that gets you back to being a profitable
          customer for them, they’re likely to be open to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your best approach, in this case, is to keep those motivations in
          mind. If your pitch is to extend repayment, the credit card company
          might be willing to work with you. This gets them paid eventually and
          retains you as a customer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose you can demonstrate to the credit card company that you have
          absolutely no way of paying the full amount you owe. In that case, it
          might negotiate a settlement for a lesser amount. From the creditor's
          point of view, settling for a little less upfront might be better than
          dragging out the process for months or years. It can avoid the expense
          of hiring a collection agency and the risk of getting far less if you
          go into bankruptcy.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are more likely to make a case for settlement if you demonstrate
          genuine financial hardship. If you've been splurging on vacations or
          luxury items in recent months, expect the credit card company to be
          suspicious of how genuine your difficulty is.

          Negotiating credit card debt relief with a collection agency
        </p>

        <p>
          If payments are overdue by six months or more, the credit card company
          may have assigned your case to a collection agency. These companies
          specialize in collecting delinquent debts, usually on behalf of the
          original creditor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Collection agencies get paid according to how much money they get from
          you, so expect them to use hardball tactics. This is where consumer
          protection law – the FDCPA – comes into play.
        </p>

        <p>
          The FDCPA applies to
          <a class="underline" href="#">debt collectors</a> that are working on
          behalf of other companies and protects consumers in the following
          ways:
        </p>

        <ul class="flex flex-col gap-4">
          <li class="flex gap-6">
            <div class="bg-primary w-6 h-6 rounded-full shrink-0 self-center">
              <img src="./assets/images/check.svg" alt="check logo" />
            </div>
            <span>
              It requires that the debt collector provide written validation of
              the credit card debt. This includes the amount of the credit card
              debt and details of who is owed.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">
            <div class="bg-primary w-6 h-6 rounded-full shrink-0 self-center">
              <img src="./assets/images/check.svg" alt="check logo" />
            </div>
            <span>
              Once that written validation is provided, the consumer has thirty
              days to dispute any or all debts listed. Any such dispute should
              be made in writing.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">

            </div>
            <span>
              If a written dispute is received from the consumer, the debt
              collector has to provide written proof of the credit card debt or
              a copy of any court judgment affirming the obligation. All debt
              collection activities must cease until this documentation is
              provided.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">

            </div>
            <span>
              Debt collectors cannot contact a consumer outside of the hours of
              8 a.m. and 9 p.m. in the customer’s time zone.
            </span>
          </li>

            </div>
            <span>
              Employers have the right to prohibit debt collectors from making
              collection calls at work or contacting their employees at their
              place of business.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">

            </div>
            <span>
              Debt collectors can only communicate about the credit card debt
              with the consumer, the consumer’s representative, the creditor and
              their representatives, and consumer reporting agencies where
              permitted by law.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">

            </div>
            <span>
              Debt collectors may not use abusive or threatening language with a
              consumer.
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Knowing these rights can help you establish ground rules that allow
          you to deal with the collection agency in an orderly manner.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because the collection agency gets paid according to how much of the
          credit card debt they collect, your communication should focus on
          proving to them the limits of what you’re able to pay. Once they know
          there’s no more money to tap into, they’d rather collect a partial
          amount and get paid than continue pursuing you without getting paid.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, don't make any partial payments until a complete settlement
          has been agreed to in writing.
        </p>

        <p>Negotiating credit card debt relief with a debt buyer</p>

        <p>
          If a credit card debt is long overdue and efforts at collecting it
          have failed, a credit card company may cut its losses and sell it to a
          debt buyer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because there is a slight chance of collecting on this kind of bad
          credit card debt, that debt is often sold for a greatly reduced
          amount. That does not affect the amount you owe, except that you would
          now owe the money to the debt buyer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once the debt buyer owns your credit card debt, they would now be
          considered an original creditor instead of a collection agency working
          on behalf of a creditor. This means that debt buyers are often not
          restricted by the FDCPA unless their primary business is debt
          collection rather than investing in bad credit card debts.
        </p>

        <p>
          When dealing with debt buyers, the key thing to remember is that they
          may have purchased your credit card debt for just pennies on the
          dollar. If you pay them any more than that, they've made a profit.
          That leaves room to negotiate.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, as with all debt collectors, debt buyers are hard-nosed
          operators who've seen it all before. They will not reduce the amount
          you owe them until they are convinced you have nothing else to give.

          “Government program” credit card debt relief
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re wondering about so-called government programs for credit
          card debt relief, the truth is there is no such thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are consumer protection laws like the FDCPA. However, if someone
          approaches you offering to enroll you in a government credit card
          relief program, it’s almost certainly a scam.

          Statutes of Limitations for Credit Card Debt
        </span>

        <p>
          Does credit card debt ever get relieved or forgiven if you wait long
          enough?
        </p>

        <p>
          Each state has a statute of limitations that governs how much time
          someone has to sue you, including for a bad credit card debt.
        </p>

        <p>
          These statutes vary from state to state and are typically three to six
          years.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, if you refuse to pay, in theory, you could try to run out the
          clock by waiting for the statute of limitations to expire. However,
          debt collectors know the game better than you. They are well aware of
          the debt's origination and how much time they have to sue.
        </p>

        <p>
          In particular, don't try to use the statute of limitations as a
          negotiating tactic by threatening to hold out until it expires unless
          the debt collector gives you the deal you want. Using that deadline as
          a threat could prompt the debt collector to initiate legal action to
          beat the time limit.

          How Debt Relief Companies Work

          multiple debt collectors after you.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is where a
          <a class="underline" href="#">debt relief company</a> can help. A debt
          relief company can help you organize your debts and figure out what

          to negotiate with your debt collectors and strike a deal on your
          behalf.
        </p>

        <p>
          In exchange for this, debt relief companies charge you based on a
          percentage of your credit card debt. So, any debt reduction they
          negotiate will be offset to some degree by what you have to pay for
          this service.

          Getting Credit Counseling Help

        <p>
          Alternatively, you could pursue a debt management plan (DMP) from a
          nonprofit credit counseling agency. This consolidates several credit
          card obligations into one payment, thereby reducing your interest
          rates and setting up, on average, a three- to five-year payback
          schedule. A DMP could be a worthy solution if you encounter challenges
          repaying your credit card bills monthly. It can affect your credit
          score less than bankruptcy or debt relief because you completely repay
          your original debt.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, credit counseling involves asking for help from a
          third party, like a nonprofit credit counseling agency.Their
          professionals are typically certified and experienced in consumer
          credit, financial and debt counseling, and budgeting. A counselor
          consults with you, reviews your finances, and helps develop a

          Whether you negotiate credit card debt relief by yourself or through a
          debt relief company, there are still costs involved.
        </p>

        <p>
          All while the process continues, your late payments will show up on
          your credit report and damage your credit score. Then, once a
          settlement is reached, that settlement will likely remain a bad mark
          on your credit history for seven years.

          If you can't reach an agreement with your creditors and don't have the

        <p>
          Bankruptcy is a legal process by which a court considers all your

          pay each creditor. This settles those credit card debts once and for
          all.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, this means giving the court control over how much of your
          income and property you'll have to put towards your credit card debt
          -- and that's likely to be a substantial amount. You may also be
          paying upfront legal and filing fees in the process.

          On top of that, the
          <a class="underline" href="#"
            >US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a
          >
          advises that bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for ten years.
          This severely restricts your ability to get credit and makes credit
          more expensive when you can get it.

          Taxes on Credit Card Debt Relief
        </span>

        <p>
          One difference between bankruptcy and other forms of credit card debt
          relief is tax treatment.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a class="underline" href="#">Internal Revenue Service rules</a> hold
          that debt canceled in a bankruptcy proceeding or other legal
          determination of insolvency is not taxable. By filing bankruptcy,
          you're essentially proving that you're insolvent. In contrast, if a
          creditor relieves your credit card debt, the amount forgiven is
          treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. To avoid taxation on
          forgiven amounts, you'll have to prove that you're insolvent.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to the IRS, "A taxpayer is insolvent when his or her total
          liabilities exceed his or her total assets. The forgiven credit card
          debt may be excluded as income under the 'insolvency' exclusion.
          Normally, a taxpayer is not required to include forgiven debts in
          income to the extent that the taxpayer is insolvent."
        </p>

        <p>
          You can be considered insolvent if your credit card debts exceed the
          value of everything you own.

          How Can Credit Card Debt Relief Work for You?
        </span>

        <p>
          If debt collectors are hounding you, you do have options. You can try
          to negotiate a settlement yourself, have a debt relief company work on
          your behalf, or as a last resort, declare bankruptcy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than scrambling to respond to each collection attempt
          individually, get organized and have a strategy. The more you can
          control the process, even if it means paying for professional credit
          card debt relief help, the better the outcome is likely to be.
