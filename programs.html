          Debt relief programs are designed to help consumers struggling with
          more debt than they can afford. In its simplest form, a debt relief
          program means that your creditors agree to accept less than what you
          owe as payment in full.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
        <p class="subtitle text-left font-bold">
          How Does a Debt Relief Program Work?
        </p>

        <p>
          Debt relief typically works this way: you enroll your unsecured
          accounts into a debt relief program with a debt settlement company.
          You stop making payments to your creditors. You and your debt
          consultant come up with an amount that you can afford, and you put
          that money into a debt settlement savings account each month. Debt
          relief programs can help you get out of debt faster. Negotiations
          begin with creditors when your debt consultant feels that you have
          saved enough. You continue to make your monthly payments into your
          debt settlement savings account as your accounts are settled one by
          one. You pay no fees to a debt settlement company until it settles a
          debt for you. You can speed up the settlement process by cutting
          expenses or selling things you don’t need to reach your savings goal
          faster.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
        <span class="subtitle text-left font-bold">
          Why would creditors agree to settle my debt?
        </span>

        <p>
          “Why would my creditors agree to settle my debt?” you might well ask.
          Creditors are not in business to lose money. They only agree to a debt
          relief program if they believe that other options will cost them more
          and that you can’t afford to pay what you owe. Creditors are less
          likely to settle if you’ve made your payments and have a good credit
          score. They assume that you’d like to protect that score and that you
          can afford to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, if you start missing payments, it becomes obvious that you’re
          having trouble paying what you owe. Creditors begin to fear that you
          might even walk away or file bankruptcy and pay nothing (or
          practically nothing). If a debt is older, your state’s statute of
          limitations for debt could kick in and make your balance
          uncollectible. Once a creditor concludes that something is better than
          nothing, you have a good chance of settling your account.

          How long does a debt relief program take?
        </p>

        <p>
          Debt relief generally takes between two and four years, depending on
          the amount of enrolled debt, how fast you can save for debt
          settlement, and how much your creditors are willing to accept. A debt
          consultant can help you estimate your timeframe. In many cases, the
          first account can be settled in four-to-six months. Over time, debt
          relief programs can help you get out of debt that you can’t afford.

        <p>
          When attempting debt settlement, you could be dealing with the
          original creditor, a debt buyer, or a collection agency.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
        <span class="subtitle text-left font-bold">
          What’s the difference between an original creditor, a debt buyer, and
          a collection agency?
        </span>

        <p>
          Original creditors are the people or companies you borrow from – like
          banks that make personal loans or credit card issuers. Protections
          guaranteed by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) do not
          apply to original creditors.
        </p>

        <p>
          So while debt collectors have to leave you alone once you ask them to
          stop contacting you, original creditors may be able to keep calling.
          Your state may or may not have laws in place to protect you from
          aggressive collection efforts from your creditors.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a class="underline" href="#">Collection agencies</a> make money by
          collecting debt for others. Original creditors may turn accounts over
          to collections and pay the agency a fee for collecting, or they may
          sell the debt at a discount to the agency. Debt collectors are covered
          by the FDCPA and must stop contacting you if you ask them to.
        </p>

        <p>
          Debt buyers purchase the right to collect a debt from original
          creditors or collection agencies. Debt buyers own the debt and have
          the same legal rights as original creditors unless their main business
          is debt collection. In that case, they fall under the FDCPA, just like
          collection agencies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why does it matter who owns your debt? It can impact the amount of
          contact you get when you’re in a debt relief program. It may also
          determine how willing the debt holder is to settle and how much it
          might accept. A debt buyer that paid pennies on the dollar for your
          old account may be willing to settle readily for a modest amount.
          While your credit card company will probably pursue you for the entire
          balance, especially if you recently charged expensive purchases.

          Is a debt relief program a good idea?
        </span>

        <p>
          <a class="underline" href="#">Debt relief</a> programs aren’t for
          everyone. They are a solution for serious debt problems, not a
          get-out-of-jail-free card for people who just don’t want to pay what
          they owe. Consider both the pros and cons of debt relief before
          committing to a program.
        </p>

        <p>
          A debt relief program may help you get out of debt if you can’t afford
          the minimum payments on your debt or if your debt is creating hardship
          for your family. It can be a better solution than bankruptcy if you
          don’t want a public filing, if you have a previous bankruptcy, or if
          you don’t want a bankruptcy court taking total control of your
          finances.

          How does a debt relief program affect my credit?
        </span>

        <p>
          Most debt relief programs require you to stop making payments to your
          creditors and instead pay into a debt settlement savings account.
          Every missed payment will lower your credit score.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you currently have a high credit score, this can be devastating.
          Those who have more to lose will lose more. But if you’re having
          trouble paying your bills and already missing payments, the damage is
          less obvious.
        </p>

        <p>
          What happens to your credit score after you graduate from a debt
          relief program? A study by the
          <a class="underline" href="#">American Fair Credit Council</a>
          concluded that clients typically improve their credit scores by 60
          points within six months after settling their last debt and continues
          to rise after that. It’s not guaranteed, though, and your result
          depends on how you choose to manage your debts in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your life should be more affordable after getting rid of debt. With a
          bit of luck and sound financial management, you should be able to pay
          your bills on time and continue to improve your credit rating.

          Can I negotiate with creditors myself?

        <p>
          There is no reason that you cannot attempt debt settlement yourself.
          Here are the steps you’d take:

        <ul class="flex flex-col gap-7">

            </div>
            <span>
              List the amounts you owe to each creditor and the minimum monthly
              payment. If collection agencies are after you, they’re probably
              demanding the entire balance owed.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">

            </div>
            <span>
              Go through your budget – your after-tax monthly income and every
              necessary cost you have. Plan to get rid of expenses you don’t
              need to live when you start your debt settlement plan.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">

            <span>
              Subtract your total required expenses from your after-tax monthly
              income. That’s how much you can afford to use for debt settlement.

            </div>
            <span>
              See how much money you can offer your creditors to settle your
              debts. Consider selling things you don’t need, borrowing against
              your 401(k) at work, or tapping your savings. That can start your
              debt settlement fund.

              Now comes the hard part. Stop paying your creditors. This is
              usually necessary because few creditors will settle an account

              settlement fund.

              afford to pay more. Do not send money until you have a signed,
              written agreement.

          How much can I save with a debt relief program?
        </span>

        <p>
          Your creditors are under no obligation to settle with you. No
          reputable debt relief company will guarantee that it can “wipe out”
          your debts or clear your balances for “pennies on the dollar.” Your
          experience will likely depend on the age of the debt, the type of
          creditor, and how well you present evidence of financial hardship.
          <br />
          If you can show that you’re insolvent and a good candidate for
          bankruptcy, you’re more likely to succeed at debt settlement than if
          you earn a high income, spend on luxuries, and can’t prove hardship.
          Statistics can help you visualize the potential for savings through
          debt settlement, but specific results cannot be guaranteed or
          predicted. A recent study by Will S. Dobbie at the Harvard Kennedy
          School entitled
          <a class="underline" href="#"
            >“Financial Outcomes for Debt Settlement Programs: Estimates for
            2011-2020”</a
          >
          found that on average, consumers settled balances of $17,032 for
          $8,365, paying fees of $3,325. That’s a reduction of 51% before fees
          and 31% savings after fees.

          Debt relief programs may be able to help you get rid of unaffordable
          debt. However, such solutions always come at a cost. If you can afford
          to repay your debt in a reasonable timeframe, consider doing so.

          What’s it Like to Go Through Debt Relief?
        </span>

        <p>
          Your experience with a debt relief program is highly individual. It
          depends on how quickly you can come up with a lump sum to settle your
          debts, the age of the debt, who your creditors are, how aggressive
          your creditors are, the size of your debt, and the amount of your
          income.

        <p>
          Here is a typical debt relief experience with a debt relief company.

          You will work with your debt counselor to decide what debts to enroll
          in the plan and develop an affordable monthly plan payment. You’ll
          also look at other ways to increase what you can offer your creditors,
          whether it’s a loan, tapping your savings, or selling some assets. You
          will probably be advised to stop making monthly payments on your
          enrolled accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your debt consultant may advise you about calls from creditors and
          debt collectors. Federal law gives you total control over how much
          contact you get from creditors, but credit card companies will
          probably continue to contact you. You may also choose to communicate
          with your creditors during this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to data from Freedom Debt Relief, your credit score is
          likely to drop substantially during the first few months of your debt
          relief program. But after that first six months, credit scores trend
          higher.

          What Happens After Graduating From a Debt Relief Program?
        </span>

        <p>
          When your last enrolled debt is settled, you graduate from debt
          relief. You are free to move on, stay on track and avoid taking on too
          much debt in the future. <br />
          You may owe taxes on forgiven debt forgiven under a debt relief
          program. The <a class="underline" href="#">IRS</a> says forgiven debt
          is taxable for the year settled unless you are financially insolvent.
          That’s why it’s crucial to determine if you qualify as insolvent or if
          you need to budget for those taxes. <br />
          According to Freedom Debt Relief data, 24% of program graduates had a
          respectable median FICO® Score of 680 or greater when they completed
          the program. Two years later, the number more than doubled to 49%.
          Your credit report is likely to show missed payments, and creditors
          can note that your account was “settled for less than the amount due.”
          These entries can remain for up to seven years and may raise questions
          when you apply for a mortgage or auto financing. <br />
          However, credit scores update continuously, and recent history gets
          more weight than older entries. Keep paying your accounts on time,
          avoid carrying balances on your credit cards, and eventually, you can
          achieve financial stability and excellent credit.

          *Our estimates are based on prior results, which will vary depending
          on your specific enrolled creditors and your individual program terms.
          Not all clients are able to complete their program for various
          reasons, including their ability to save sufficient funds. We do not
          guarantee that your debts will be resolved for a specific amount or
          percentage or within a specific period of time. We do not assume your
          debts, make monthly payments to creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy,
          accounting or legal advice or credit repair services. Our service is
          not available in all states, including New Jersey, and our fees may
          vary from state to state. Please contact a tax professional to discuss
          potential tax consequences of less than full balance debt resolution.
          Read and understand all program materials prior to enrollment. The use
          of debt settlement services will likely adversely affect your
          creditworthiness, may result in you being subject to collections or
          being sued by creditors or collectors and may increase the outstanding
          balances of your enrolled accounts due to the accrual of fees and
          interest. However, negotiated settlements we obtain on your behalf
          resolve the entire account, including all accrued fees and interest.

        <p class="text-lg">
          ** This guarantee takes effect when you graduate the program—or even
          if you leave before graduating. When you exit the program, we’ll use
          the combined total of all the debts you enrolled and settled and the
          fees you paid to us to calculate your eligibility for a refund.
