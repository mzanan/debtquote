        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            The type of debt relief Freedom Debt Relief offers is known by
            several names: debt resolution, debt negotiation, and debt
            settlement. Debt relief allows you to resolve your unsecured debt
            (debt that is not backed by collateral like a car or a house; most
            often credit card debt) by negotiating with creditors and reducing
            the amount you owe. You could negotiate with your creditors on your
            own or use a debt relief program like Freedom Debt Relief to help
            you settle your debt.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            During the debt relief process, you usually voluntarily stop paying
            your creditors and start saving money in a special purpose account
            (what Freedom Debt Relief calls your 'dedicated account') that is
            used to hold the funds used to settle your debt. Once enough money
            is saved into this account, the debt relief company you hired
            contacts your creditors to negotiate a debt settlement amount that
            is lower than what you currently owe.
          </p>

          What is Debt Quote?
        </p>
        <p>
          DebtQuote is the largest debt negotiator in the U.S. We offer our debt
          relief program to Americans with unsecured debt (debt that is not
          backed by collateral like a car or a house)—including credit card
          debt, personal loan debt, and medical debt—and are experiencing a
          legitimate financial hardship.

          How does Debt Quote work?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Freedom Debt Relief program is designed to resolve your debt for
          significantly less than you owe, as quickly as possible. First, we
          provide a debt consultation to review various options you have for
          debt management (including credit counseling, bankruptcy, and
          consolidation loan), and help you decide if debt relief and our
          program specifically is right for you. If you decide that it is, we
          work with you to design a program that fits your monthly budget (keep
          in mind that it could be less than your monthly minimum payments).
          Once you enroll, our expert debt negotiators create a negotiation
          strategy, utilizing data that has been developed over 20 years, so
          that we can reduce your debt and help get rid of your debt as quickly
          as possible. Our company has used this method to resolve over $15
          billion in debt since 2002.

          What types of debt can DebtQuote help me with?
        </p>
        <p>
          Freedom Debt Relief could help you with debt from credit cards,
          medical bills, department store cards, and many other types of
          unsecured debt (debt that is not backed by collateral like a car or a
          house). Our program cannot help with secured debt, which is a debt
          that involves collateral (like auto loans and mortgages). Also, we
          cannot resolve federal student loans. We do help with private student
          loans and some business debts on a case-by-case basis.

          How does debt relief affect my credit score?
        </p>
        <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
          <p>
            The impact a debt relief solution has to your credit score depends
            on the specific information found on your credit report at the time
            of enrollment, and how the specific information found on your credit
            report changes while in the program. Your credit report can be
            affected by the settlements you experienced while in the program
            (including how creditors report the information to the CRAs) as well
            as your credit behavior while in the program. Depending on your
            existing credit score, in the debt settlement process you will
            likely see your credit score drop.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, a key factor of your financial health is your
            debt-to-income ratio. As debts are settled, your total debt should
            decrease, thereby improving your debt-to-income ratio.
          </p>

          How much does debt relief cost?
        </p>
        <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
          <p>
            Across the industry, debt relief costs vary and are usually a
            percentage of the original amount of your debt or a percentage of
            the amount you've agreed to pay with the settlement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Freedom Debt Relief’s fee ranges between 15% to 25% of enrolled debt
            (the amount of debt enrolled to be settled)–your rate may vary
            depending on your state of residency and amount you enroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our program, clients pay FDR no fee whatsoever until a debt is
            negotiated, the settlement has been approved and the first payment
            has been made. You will know when a fee is charged because you will
            approve every settlement deal. Once we reach a settlement with a
            creditor, we immediately contact you for authorization. After you
            authorize a settlement and a payment has been made to your creditor,
            the fee associated with the debt is processed. The total fee
            associated with the program is included in the monthly savings
            quoted to you by a debt consultant.

            FDR does not charge any upfront fees and only collects its fees
            after a settlement is authorized by the client and the first payment
            is made.

            Note: As part of your debt settlement program, you open up a
            dedicated account with Crossroads Financial Technologies (CFT) to
            accumulate your settlement funds. You own this dedicated account and
            all funds in it. CFT collects fees for setting up and maintaining
            the dedicated account, and may also charge fees to make payments
            from the dedicated account. There is a one-time fee of $9.95 to set
            up the dedicated account, and a monthly fee of $9.95 that covers
            account servicing. Freedom Debt Relief does not share or receive any
            part of the fees paid to CFT.

          How is DebtQuote different from other debt relief options?

            Freedom Debt Relief is an established leader in debt resolution.
            Since 2002, over 850,000 clients have been served by the Freedom

            that offers the best opportunity for consumers to achieve their
            financial goals. 3. Each customer is fully informed at each step of
            the process. 4. Each customer has a Program Guarantee that Freedom
            Debt Relief succeeds only when our customers succeed. In addition to
            only charging fees when FDR delivers settlements, the Program
            Guarantee states that when a customer graduates or leaves the
            program, FDR will refund fees if their settlement and fees are more
            than the amount they originally owed when they enrolled in the
            program.

          What is the difference between credit counseling, debt settlement and

              Credit counseling can help you learn to budget and stop
              overspending. Counselors can enroll you in a debt management plan
              where they typically lower your interest rates and set up a
              payment schedule, to simplify debt repayment and make it more
              affordable. Credit counselors control your (the consumer’s) money
              and when/how the money is distributed to the creditors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Debt settlement means convincing your creditors to accept less
              than you owe as payment in full. They may be willing to do so if
              you cannot afford to repay the full amount. With debt settlement,
              and specifically Freedom Debt Relief, you the consumer approve all
              actions by Freedom Debt Relief - i.e. Freedom Debt Relief does not
              control your money and when/how the money is distributed to
              creditors - everything must be approved by you, the consumer.

              Bankruptcy is a court-ordered plan in which you either surrender
              assets or pay into a plan to discharge some or all of your debts.

          Can I withdraw money from my dedicated account with DebtQuote?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, you may withdraw from your Dedicated Account, which you control,
          at any time. This is an FDIC-insured account, and you control it, not
          Freedom Debt Relief, meaning you can withdraw from it at any time.
          However, FDR advises against withdrawing from your account as it
          prevents you from being able to make your monthly deposits, which in
          turn slows down your progress towards your settlement timeframe.

          What benefits can I expect from DebtQuote?
        </p>
        <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
          <p>
            DebtQuote has various benefits in place to assure that customers are
            placed at the center of everything we do, and that Freedom Debt
            Relief is the solution recommended only when it is truly the best
            fit for the customer’s needs and circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            These benefits are in place with the Freedom Debt Relief Promise,
            which has four components in total that help assure that 1. You (the
            customer) can make informed decisions, with a free debt
            consultation; 2. You will be set up for success, with a free
            financial assessment that includes cash flow analysis; 3. You won’t
            be surprised, with clear terms and our commitment to transparency;
            and 4. You will get results, with our Program Guarantee* that states
            that if your total program settlement cost is more than the total
            amount of debt you enroll in our program, we’ll refund you the
            difference, up to 100% of our collected fees.*
          </p>
          <p>
            Another benefit is our partnership with a network of attorneys, the
            Legal Partner Network, that specializes in debt negotiation. The
            cost of the Legal Partner Network service is included in your
            program and will be available to you as long as you make all your
            deposits on time and in the full amount. For more information,
            please see question:“What do I do if my creditor takes legal
            actions?”

            Lastly, Freedom Debt Relief provides complimentary tools and
            guidance to help customers succeed including an online dashboard for
            clients, with access 24/7 and the ability to chat with Customer
            Service 7 days a week. In the dashboard, clients can access various
            videos and articles to grow your financial skills.

            *For purposes of this settlement fee refund, your “FDR program
            settlement costs” are (a) the total amount you paid to your
            creditors through your FDR program, plus (b) the total settlement
            fees paid to us as described in Subsection 5.a. (excluding any other
            fees, costs or taxes you may incur).

          <p>
            In the event you charge, draw, or take advances on a debt after
            enrollment, that debt, and any FDR program settlement costs
            associated with that debt, will not be considered for purposes of
            this settlement fee refund.

          Our program is focused on dealing with unsecured debts (debts that are
          not backed by collateral such as debt from credit cards, medical
          bills, and unsecured personal loans, etc.). We can’t help with debt
          that is secured by collateral (such as mortgages or auto loans).
          However, after completing the program, the money you had been paying
          towards your unsecured creditors can be used to pay down secured debts
          and start saving for your financial future. Not everyone completes our
          program, so remember that sticking to your monthly savings plan is the
          most important factor in determining your success

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
          <p>
            Creditors may attempt to collect on enrolled debts by taking legal
            action. While we (FDR) are not lawyers or licensed to practice law,
            we want to make sure that if any enrolled accounts go into
            litigation, the debt can still be negotiated.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve partnered with a network of attorneys, the Legal Partner
            Network, that specializes in debt negotiation. If any enrolled
            creditor files a lawsuit against a client, we may engage a Legal
            Partner Network attorney who will attempt to negotiate a settlement
            with the creditor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus of the attorney is to try to get the creditor to settle
            the lawsuit and resolve the debt. The attorney will not represent
            the client in court or file paperwork.
          </p>

            The cost of the Legal Partner Network service is included in the
            program (without any subscription or service fees) and will be
            available to the client as long as they make all of their deposits

          There are bad actors in the category of debt settlement, and we

            Freedom Debt Relief is a legitimate company

          We are a founding member of the American Fair Credit Council (AFCC)

          Does DebtQuote start negotiating with my creditors right away?
        </p>
        <p>
          Negotiation activity is typically very limited until you have saved up
          enough in your settlement account (also referred to as 'dedicated
          account') to
          <a

            make reasonable offers to your creditors </a
          >. Most (but not all) creditors do not want to spend time negotiating
          an account unless they know there are funds available. The first
          settlement typically happens between months four and six of a client’s
          program, but this varies greatly depending on your monthly deposit
          amount, the number of creditors you have enrolled in the program, and
          the balance of each individual account. Over 60% of clients get their
          first debt settled in the first 3 months of enrollment. In some
          instances, it may take more than six months before the first
          settlement is reached.

          How long does DebtQuote take?

        <p>
          The Freedom Debt Relief program is unique to each client. The program
          length for Freedom Debt Relief customers is on average 24-48 months.*
          The length of time that a client is enrolled depends on many factors,
          like the amount of debt they have, who their creditors are, and the
          amount the client is able to save/deposit every month, as well as the
          consistency of those deposits. The Freedom Debt Relief team works with
          each client to build a program and schedule that fits their specific
          needs.

        </p>
        <p>
          Freedom Debt Relief helps consumers that have experienced a hardship
          (such as job loss, reduced income, unexpected expenses, medical, and
          divorce) and are struggling with unsecured debts, including credit
          cards, medical, department store and personal loan debts.

          When should you consider debt relief?
        </p>
        <p>
          Consumers should consider debt relief if they have recently gone
          through a hardship and are struggling to make minimum payments or can
          make payments but still can't seem to make a dent in the debt. In many
          cases, debt settlement is a good alternative to a loan or bankruptcy,
          or credit counseling.
