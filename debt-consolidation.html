          Debt consolidation is a debt management strategy where you combine
          multiple debts into a single payment. When you use this method, you
          may be able to simplify your payment schedule and get a lower interest
          rate than you’re currently paying on your debts. If you owe more than
          $5,000 in credit card debt spread over many different cards, debt
          consolidation could make it easier for you to make a single payment
          each month instead of worrying about organizing your bills and paying
          each one on time.

          And since average interest rates on credit cards can range anywhere

          you save on interest. If you’re considering debt consolidation, there
          are a few different strategies you could use.

          Credit card debt relief might be a better choice if you can’t qualify
          for or afford debt consolidation. Credit card debt relief means
          settling with your credit card companies for less than what you owe.
          Credit card debt relief is different from debt consolidation because
          debt consolidation does not reduce your balances. Understand that no
          creditor is required to settle a debt. However, many creditors are
          willing to work with consumers and come to an agreement.

          How to Consolidate Debt
        </span>

        <p>
          You consolidate debt by combining it all into one payment each month.
          There are many ways to consolidate debt. If you choose one of these
          three popular ways to consolidate debt, that payment could be to a
          lender, another credit card company, or a debt relief program:

            Balance Transfer Cards
          </span>
        </div>

        <p>
          Credit card companies know better than anyone that the average U.S.
          household owes $15,654 in credit card debt alone, and they’ve come up
          with a debt management solution called a balance transfer card. A
          balance transfer card is a high-limit credit card that allows you to
          consolidate your existing credit card debt into a single line of
          credit and gives you a chance to pay it off at a low rate for a set
          amount of time. Some balance transfer cards offer promotional rates
          starting as low as 0% APR for 12 months or more. If you’re carrying
          multiple balances on cards that have high interest, it’s easy to see
          why you could be tempted by this offer. But balance transfer cards
          might not be that great of a deal in the long run.
        </p>

        <span class="text-center font-bold">
          Many balance transfer cards require you to pay a fee for each new debt
          that you transfer over to the card.
        </span>

        <p>
          Many balance transfer cards require you to pay a fee for each new debt
          that you transfer over to the card. This charge can be anywhere
          between 3%-5% of the original balance. So, if you were to transfer a
          credit card debt of $1,000 onto a balance transfer card, you would end
          up paying your credit card company $30-$50 just to get the balance
          transferred over. While that doesn’t seem like very much for one
          single debt, imagine how much you’d end up paying in transfer fees
          alone if you owed upwards of $10,000! To make things even less
          enticing, once the promotional period ends on your balance transfer
          card, your rate is subject to change. Many balance transfer cards have
          the same interest rates as any other credit card after the promotional
          0% APR period expires. So if you don’t pay off the debt during the
          promotional period, you may end up with almost the same amount of debt
          at the same rate that you had before transferring your balance over.
        </p>

        <span class="text-primary font-bold">
          When to Use a Balance Transfer Card for Debt Consolidation
        </span>

        <p>
          If you have several different debts with high interest rates and can
          pay off all of your existing credit card debt within the promotional
          period, balance transfer cards may be the right debt consolidation
          solution for you. But if you have a lot of credit card debt and can’t
          afford to pay it all off within the promotional period, a balance
          transfer card could land you in the same financial situation that you
          were stuck in before.

            Debt Consolidation Loans
          </span>
        </div>

        <p>
          Another way to consolidate debt is through a personal debt
          consolidation loan. Personal loans are very popular financial products
          nowadays, partly because you can use a personal loan for almost
          anything-like paying for a major expense, wedding, or vacation. But
          one of the most popular ways to use a personal loan is as a debt
          consolidation loan. By rolling all of your unsecured debt into a debt
          consolidation loan, you may be able to simplify your payments and pay
          your debt off at a lower rate. Since debt consolidation loans have
          terms ranging from 24-72 months, they could help you get out of debt
          in less time than it takes to make minimum payments. Unlike balance
          transfer cards, debt consolidation loans are usually fixed-rate loans.
          Their rates won’t go up unless you miss your payments. Debt
          consolidation loan rates typically range from 10%-32%, depending on
          your credit profile, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors. Although
          there’s no fee for rolling all your debt into a debt consolidation
          loan, some consolidation loans require you to pay an origination fee.
          These fees can range from 1%-6% of the total loan, but certain loan
          providers waive this fee entirely. There are two main ways to take out
          a debt consolidation loan: you could find a loan provider online, or
          you could go to your local bank or credit union to find a debt
          consolidation loan. Since different lenders will provide you different
          rates, it’s a good idea to compare your rates and find the best deal
          for you before you sign a contract for a debt consolidation loan.
        </p>

        <span class="text-primary font-bold">
          When to Use a Debt Consolidation Loan
        </span>

        <p>
          A consolidation loan could help simplify your payment schedule and
          lower your interest rate, but you may pay more each month to get out
          of debt faster. For example, if you have $15,000 in credit card debt
          and are making minimum payments with 16.99% APR, it could take you 258
          months to pay off your credit card debt and cost you approximately
          $450 every month. If you took out a debt consolidation loan with a
          rate of 13% APR, you could be debt-free in 36 months, but at the cost
          of $505 every month.

        <p>
          A debt consolidation loan could be worth exploring if you can get a
          lower rate than you’re currently paying on your credit card debt and
          you can afford to make your new monthly payments. Unfortunately, some
          people who are struggling with heavy credit card debt can’t get a good
          rate on a debt consolidation loan because their credit score is too
          low and their debt to income ratio (DTI) is too high.

            Cash-Out Refinance
          </span>
        </div>

        <p>
          Homeowners who need to consolidate debt could do a cash-out refinance
          to pay off their existing credit card debt at a lower rate and have
          more time to pay it off. By refinancing your home loan and taking out
          more money than you owe on your mortgage, you can use the additional
          cash to consolidate your debt. Then, you just continue to pay your
          mortgage like you normally would, with your unsecured debt rolled into
          it. A cash-out refinance is a type of mortgage, and terms are usually
          5, 15, or 30 years long. Since the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate
          in 2017 was 3.99%, a cash-out refinance could provide you a
          significantly lower interest rate than the debt you’re trying to pay
          off. Consolidating debt with a cash-out refinance might seem like an
          easy choice, but there are risks involved in this debt management
          strategy. Since your mortgage is attached to your home and is
          therefore considered a secured debt, your home could be foreclosed on
          or repossessed if you are unable to pay your mortgage. That’s why it’s
          critical to make sure you can afford your payments if you decide to
          use this debt consolidation tactic. Keep in mind that a cash-out
          refinance is a mortgage, which means that you may have to pay all of
          the fees associated with a mortgage when you do a cash-out refinance.
          Home appraisal, origination costs, and closing cost are still in
          effect when you refinance-so be prepared to pay these expenses before
          you consolidate debt with a cash-out refinance.

        <span class="text-[22px] leading-7 text-primary font-semibold">
          When to Use Cash-Out Refinance to Consolidate Debt
        </span>

        <p>
          If you own a home, have a lot of high-interest credit card debt, and
          can afford the fees and your new monthly mortgage payment, a cash-out
          refinance could be the right debt management option for you. Similar
          to a debt consolidation loan, part of your new mortgage rate is
          determined by your credit score and debt-to-income ratio (DTI). If you
          have a low credit score or your debt-to-income ratio is too high, you
          may have trouble qualifying for a worthwhile interest rate.

          Debt Consolidation vs Credit Card Debt Relief
        </span>

        <p>
          Credit card debt relief and debt consolidation are sometimes presented
          as the same type of debt management solution, but they are very
          different. Depending on your specific financial situation, one
          solution could be better than the other. If you’re thinking about debt
          consolidation, there are a few factors to consider first.

          Are You Eligible for Debt Consolidation?
        </span>

        <p>
          Debt consolidation loans, balance transfer cards, and cash-out
          refinancing each have limits on how much you can borrow. Loan amounts
          for balance transfer cards and debt consolidation loans could be
          $1,000-$50,000. To qualify for a cash-out refinance, you need to have
          equity in your home that you can borrow against. If you do have equity
          in your home, you may only be able to borrow up to 97% against your
          home’s current value. Even if you are eligible for debt consolidation,
          you may not qualify for a favorable rate that is less that your
          current debts. Many companies that offer debt consolidation loans
          dangle ultra-low rates in front of you to get you in the door, but
          they can’t offer you that kind of rate unless you have an excellent
          FICO score and a low debt-to-income ratio. If you’re considering a
          balance transfer card, you may not even qualify unless your credit
          score is excellent. And if you want to do a cash-out refinance, you
          might have trouble finding a low rate without excellent credit.

        *Our estimates are based on prior results, which will vary depending on
        your specific enrolled creditors and your individual program terms. Not
        all clients are able to complete their program for various reasons,
        including their ability to save sufficient funds. We do not guarantee
        that your debts will be resolved for a specific amount or percentage or
        within a specific period of time. We do not assume your debts, make
        monthly payments to creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting or
        legal advice or credit repair services. Our service is not available in
        all states, including New Jersey, and our fees may vary from state to
        state. Please contact a tax professional to discuss potential tax
        consequences of less than full balance debt resolution. Read and
        understand all program materials prior to enrollment. The use of debt
        settlement services will likely adversely affect your creditworthiness,
        may result in you being subject to collections or being sued by
        creditors or collectors and may increase the outstanding balances of
        your enrolled accounts due to the accrual of fees and interest. However,
        negotiated settlements we obtain on your behalf resolve the entire
        account, including all accrued fees and interest. C.P.D. Reg. No.

        ** This guarantee takes effect when you graduate the program—or even if
        you leave before graduating. When you exit the program, we’ll use the
        combined total of all the debts you enrolled and settled and the fees
        you paid to us to calculate your eligibility for a refund.
