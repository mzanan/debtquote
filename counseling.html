          Feel like you don’t know how to keep your finances under control?
          You’re not alone. Nearly 43% of Americans failed a national financial
          literacy test. Meanwhile, millions across the country are in heavy
          credit card debt. Many don’t have any money saved for retirement. And
          many don’t know how to budget.

          help you get out of debt. But before committing to this option, learn
          about credit card counseling pros and cons.

          Consumer credit counseling agencies offer free workshops and
          resources. These can help you with budgeting, debt management, saving
          money, and establishing long-term financial goals. Credit counselors
          who work at these agencies can also evaluate your budget. They can
          discuss your financial concerns and position you to improve your
          situation.

        <span>
          If you’re having issues paying off your debt, a credit counseling
          agency may help. Depending on how much you owe, they could give you
          resources and advice to help you get out of debt. Or they can offer a
          Debt Management Plan to help you free yourself from debt.

          What is a debt management plan?
        </span>

        <p>
          Consumer credit counseling agencies offer something called a Debt
          Management Plan (DMP, also known as a Debt Management Program) to help
          you manage your debts and your credit health. These plans can save you
          money in some cases if the counselor negotiates with your creditors to
          reduce the interest rates on your accounts and waive certain fees.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
        <p class="">Here’s how a DMP works:</p>

            </div>
            <span>
              You request an evaluation by a credit counselor. The two of you
              will discuss your income, monthly expenses, credit card and debt
              balances, and other financial obligations. The counselor will pull
              your credit report with a soft credit check that won’t affect your
              credit score. After reviewing your information, they will map out
              your debt relief options and let you know if a Debt Management
              Plan is right for you.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">
            <div class="bg-primary w-6 h-6 rounded-full shrink-0 self-center">
              <img src="./assets/images/check.svg" alt="check logo" />
            </div>
            <span>
              If you qualify for a DMP, your credit counselor will help you
              enroll. You choose which debts you want to enter into the program
              and decide how much you can pay each month into your Debt
              Management Plan account, run by your credit counseling agency to
              pay your creditors.
            </span>

            </div>
            <span>
              Then, the credit counseling agency contacts your creditors to
              negotiate a lower interest rate. This reduced rate is called a
              concession rate. When your creditor agrees to the new terms, you
              countersign the agreement and start your Debt Management Plan.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">

            </div>
            <span>
              After your Debt Management Plan is set up, you’ll pay a startup
              fee. Then you’ll make monthly payments into an account that the
              credit counseling agency uses to pay your creditors. Your credit
              counseling agency will also collect a monthly fee for maintaining
              your Debt Management Plan.

            </div>
            <span>
              You continue to pay into your Debt Management Plan account, and
              your credit counseling agency continues to pay your creditors
              until all of your debt is gone. This process usually lasts 3-5
              years.

          Credit card counseling pros and cons
        </p>

        <p>
          As with any other debt relief option, credit counseling has its pluses
          and minuses.
        </p>

        <p class="text-primary font-bold">
          Benefits of consumer credit counseling
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest perks of working with a credit counseling agency?
          They can help you consolidate your outstanding debt into a single
          account.
        </p>

        <p>
          Making just one monthly payment can simplify your finances. You won’t
          have to fret about different due dates. Simpler repayment means less
          financial stress.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think about that. You can consolidate without needing a new loan or
          taking on more debt. Additionally, all of your DMP payments will go
          directly toward your debt. As a result, you might be able to pay off
          your debt more quickly compared to going it alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          What’s more, the credit counseling agency can work to get you a lower
          interest rate. The goal is to have you pay off all of your existing
          debt within five years. This is more than doable if your agency can
          reduce your rates, finance charges, and fees.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, the counselor will help you create a workable monthly budget.
          You’ll learn to organize your money better and adopt healthier
          financial habits.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have delinquent accounts, you can expect fewer collection calls
          after enrolling in the DMP. After creditors accept your DMP, the pesky
          phone calls, emails, and messages from debt collection agencies should
          stop or slow down.

          Disadvantages of consumer credit counseling
        </p>

        <p>
          Credit counseling is a good option if you have modest debts. But there
          are downsides. Qualifying for a Debt Management Plan may be hard if
          you have a large debt and don’t make enough income. For these and
          other reasons, some creditors may not agree to participate in your
          DMP. These creditors will need to be paid back separately. DMPs only
          apply to unsecured debt, such as personal loans or credit cards. So if
          you have auto loans, a mortgage, or other debts like student loans, a
          DMP won’t help with these. You won’t be allowed to use credit while
          your DMP is in effect. You’ll have to close your credit accounts to
          prevent getting into more debt. New lines of credit will be closed to
          you, as well. <br />
          Professional debt help isn’t free. For a DMP you’ll pay a startup fee
          and monthly fees. Fees vary, so you’ll need to research a credit
          counselor that offers an affordable plan. Your initial setup fee can
          cost $50 or more. <br />
          Monthly fees are often $40-$70. <br />
          Your credit score could drop slightly after enrolling in a DMP and
          closing credit accounts. But your score should bounce back soon if you
          make your DMP payments on time. <br />
          Lastly, a DMP has limitations. Your credit counseling agency can help
          you decrease interest rates and avoid certain fees. But they can’t
          help you reduce the principal amount you owe. <br />
          If you have a massive debt amount, you might want to look into debt
          settlement instead. Debt settlement could get you out of debt for less
          than a DMP may charge. That’s because debt settlement works to
          negotiate with creditors to shrink your total debt amount – not just
          the interest rate. You can learn more about
          <a class="underline" href="#">debt settlement here</a>.

          Even if a credit counseling agency seems legitimate, keep your guard
          up. Plenty of companies look good on paper but could end up being
          scams. Here are some red flags that the credit counseling agency
          you’re dealing with is too good to be true:

          Credit counseling agencies: the bottom line
        </p>

        <p>
          Credit counseling agencies can offer multiple ways to deal with debt
          stress—from free resources to Debt Management Plans. With their help,
          you could be debt-free, faster, and for less money than it would take
          to pay off your debt by making minimum payments. But, like all other
          debt-relief options, credit counseling has pros and cons. If you’re
          deep in debt and having trouble making minimum monthly payments, a
          credit counseling agency may not be the best choice. Weigh all of your
          debt relief options before committing to one.
