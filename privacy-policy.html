                  in order to better understand our Users’ needs and to optimize

                  better understand our Users’ Site-related experience (e.g. how
                  much time they spend on which Site pages, which links they
                  click on, what Users do and do not like, etc.) and this
                  enables us to build and maintain our offerings. Hotjar uses
                  cookies and other technology to collect data on our Users’

                  devices’ IP addresses (captured and stored only in anonymized
                  form), device screen size, device type, browser information,
                  geographic location (country only) and preferred language used
                  to display our website). Hotjar stores this information in a

                  ever use this information to identify individual Users or to

            Right to Request Deletion

          <p>
            You have the right to request that we delete your personal
            information that we collected from you and retained, subject to
            certain exceptions. Once we receive your request and confirm your
            identity, we will review your request to delete your personal
            information from our (their) records, unless a CCPA exception
            applies.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is
            necessary for us or our service providers to:
          </p>

          <p>
            Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal
            information, provide a good or service that you requested, take
            actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing
            business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our obligations
            in connection with our contract with you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please be advised that deleting your personal information may
            terminate your access to certain of the Site Offerings. If you wish
            to continue using the full complement of Site Offerings, we may not
            be able to delete all of the personal information that we have on
            file for you.

          <p>
            Further after we delete your personal information, residual copies
            may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active
            servers and may remain in our backup systems.

          *Our estimates are based on prior results, which will vary depending
          on your specific enrolled creditors and your individual program terms.
          Not all clients are able to complete their program for various
          reasons, including their ability to save sufficient funds. We do not
          guarantee that your debts will be resolved for a specific amount or
          percentage or within a specific period of time. We do not assume your
          debts, make monthly payments to creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy,
          accounting or legal advice or credit repair services. Our service is
          not available in all states, including New Jersey, and our fees may
          vary from state to state. Please contact a tax professional to discuss
          potential tax consequences of less than full balance debt resolution.
          Read and understand all program materials prior to enrollment. The use
          of debt settlement services will likely adversely affect your
          creditworthiness, may result in you being subject to collections or
          being sued by creditors or collectors and may increase the outstanding
          balances of your enrolled accounts due to the accrual of fees and
          interest. However, negotiated settlements we obtain on your behalf
          resolve the entire account, including all accrued fees and interest.

          ** This guarantee takes effect when you graduate the program—or even
          if you leave before graduating. When you exit the program, we’ll use
          the combined total of all the debts you enrolled and settled and the
          fees you paid to us to calculate your eligibility for a refund.
