        Debt consolidation may help you pay your debt off faster, simplify your
        finances and improve your credit score. It can save you money if you
        approach it correctly. However, debt consolidation done wrong can leave
        you in a much worse financial position. This guide to successful debt
        consolidation can help you avoid the pitfalls and enjoy the rewards.

          What Is Debt Consolidation?
        </p>

        <span>
          The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) defines debt
          consolidation as a “type of loan that collects many of your debts into
          one loan with one loan payment.” But the CFPB goes on to stress that
          debt consolidation doesn’t eliminate or reduce any of your debts. It
          merely rearranges them into a more convenient form. If you owe $2,000
          on one credit card and $3,000 on a line of credit and then consolidate
          them with a $5,000 debt consolidation loan, you still owe $5,000.

          interest rates on your credit cards range from 17% to 27%. You pay
          them off with a 7% home equity loan. In that case, you can reduce your
          monthly expense, drop your interest rate, and combine several payments
          into one.

          Optimize Your Loan Term
        </span>

        <p>
          Getting a loan with a lower interest rate and a longer term can reduce
          your interest rate and lower your payment. However, too long a term
          could cost you more, even if the rate is lower.
        </p>

        <p>
          For instance, if you owe $5,000 on a credit card with a 17% interest
          rate, and your minimum payment is $100 per month, it will take 79
          months to clear that debt and cost you $2,896 in interest. If you
          refinance it to a 15-year home equity loan at 10% interest, your
          payment drops to $53 a month. But it will cost you $4,671 in interest
          by the time you pay it off.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, you want to optimize the term of your new loan to suit your needs.
          You want it to be short enough to pay off within a reasonable period.
          But you don’t want it to be so short that you’ll struggle to make your
          monthly payments. One solution is to take a loan with a payment you
          can make easily but then pay it down as fast as you can.

          Prepayment Penalties
        </span>

        <p>
          Nowadays, few loans come with prepayment penalties. But there are
          still a few around. And you should check your loan agreements for any
          debts you plan to consolidate. Store or credit cards don’t have such
          penalties.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don’t automatically think you can’t consolidate an account because it
          has a prepayment penalty. Sometimes, these can be very small, though
          not always. So, call your lender and ask how much you’ll have to pay.
          Then decide whether it’s so much that it makes consolidation of that
          particular debt uneconomic.

          When Does Debt Consolidation Make Sense?
        </span>

        <p>
          It’s usually a good idea to undergo debt consolidation before you
          begin to experience real problems. If you wait until you start
          skipping payments or making them late, you’ll likely have already
          damaged your credit score.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that means you’ll probably have to pay a higher interest rate on
          your debt consolidation loan. Leave it too long, and you might lose a
          lot of the savings you stood to make if you’d acted earlier.
        </p>

          Make Sure You Benefit
        </span>

        <span>
          There’s no point in consolidating your debts unless you’re going to
          achieve one or more of these three benefits:
        </span>

        <ul class="flex flex-col gap-4">
          <li class="flex gap-6">

            </div>
            <span>
              Reduce the interest you’re paying. A rate on your new loan that’s
              lower than the ones you’re currently paying should do the trick.
            </span>

              Lower your monthly payments – you probably want to have more

              Repay your debts faster – If your cash flow is good, you could

          Address Overspending Before Debt Consolidation
        </span>

        <p>
          Many who need debt consolidation have had problems managing their
          spending. That’s not always your fault. You may be facing medical
          bills or have experienced a period of unemployment. And you had to let
          your credit cards or other borrowing take the strain.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, often, you’re in this position because you overspent trying to
          maintain an unsustainable lifestyle. Again, that might not be your
          fault. Some people are better money managers than others. You might as
          well blame yourself for not being an Olympic sprinter as for being
          inept with your finances. It’s who you are. No judgment here.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, you really can’t leave things the way they are. If you
          consolidate your debt and then keep spending beyond your means, you’re
          heading for a world of pain. Because you’ll have to repay your debt
          consolidation loan and all the new borrowing you accumulate afterward.
        </p>

        <p>
          The federal regulator we quoted earlier, the CFPB, has a good article
          about this. Do read it. But, briefly, it suggests you:
        </p>

        <ul class="flex flex-col gap-4">
          <li class="flex gap-6">

            </div>
            <span>
              Take a good look at your spending – If you understand where your
              money’s going, you can find ways to cut back in the least painful
              areas. Track over a month where every cent you spend goes.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">

            </div>
            <span>
              Make a budget – Set a limit on costs that vary each month. And
              keep track of how you’re doing. You may be able to increase your
              budget for something you genuinely value by reducing the amount
              you spend on something less important to you.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="flex gap-6">
            <div class="bg-primary w-6 h-6 rounded-full shrink-0 self-center">

            <span>
              Reach out to your creditors. The CFPB says, “Some creditors might
              be willing to accept lower minimum monthly payments, waive certain
              fees, reduce your interest rate, or change your monthly due date
              to match up better to when you get paid, to help you pay back your
              debt.”
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Consider credit counseling and/or a debt management plan (DMP) if your
          spending is beyond self-help. With a DMP, you’re usually required to
          close your credit cards and then make a single monthly payment into
          the plan. That payment is distributed to your creditors. Because your
          cards are closed, you can’t run your balances back up. And credit
          counselors can show you how to budget.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">

          Does Debt Consolidation Hurt Your Credit Score?
        </span>

        <p>
          Yes, your credit score will probably fall when you consolidate your
          debts. But it’s likely to be a minor hit that lasts a brief time. And,
          soon after, you might well see your score boosted – perhaps by a lot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lenders pull your credit report when you apply for a debt
          consolidation loan. And every inquiry causes your score to drop a few
          points. (That’s why you should prequalify first and only authorize a
          credit report when you’re ready to apply for a loan.)
        </p>

        <p>
          But once you zero out your credit cards and other unsecured accounts,
          your score could rise dramatically. That’s because your credit
          utilization will normally fall, and credit utilization is 30% of your
          score. This isn’t your total debt. It’s the proportion of your credit
          limits that your card balances make up. People with the best credit
          keep balances below 30% of their credit limits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is an example of how debt consolidation can improve your
          utilization and credit rating.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose you have credit cards with a total spending limit of $10,000,
          and your balances total $8,000. That’s 80% utilization, which is
          relatively high. By paying them off with an $8,000 personal loan or
          home equity loan, your utilization drops to 0%. That’s because
          installment loans don’t count in the utilization calculation. Note
          that you still owe $8,000, but your utilization is much-improved.

          Personal loans for debt consolidation
        </span>

        <p>
          This is the first choice for many, especially those who aren’t
          homeowners. You apply to your bank or an online lender for a personal
          loan, and you use the proceeds of that to pay down your existing
          debts.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">
          The interest rate you’re offered will mainly depend on two things:

            </div>
            <span> Your choice of lender </span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <span>
          That second one is important. Some lenders offer the same borrower a
          much better interest rate than others, so do your research. In
          addition, many personal loans come with fees. Compare loan fees and
          interest rates before applying. The annual percentage rate, which
          lenders have to disclose by law, incorporates both the interest rate
          and the costs to obtain a loan so you can compare offers more easily.
        </span>

        <span>
          But don’t apply to multiple lenders, or you risk damaging your credit
          score. FICO has a list of loans that you can apply for many times with
          a minimal effect on your score: “mortgage, auto and student loans.”
          And personal loans aren’t among those. However, most personal loan
          providers allow consumers to prequalify without pulling their credit.
          Do this with a few before choosing your lender and applying.

          Cash-out refinances and home equity loans
        </span>

        <span>
          These are only available to homeowners whose homes are worth more than
          their mortgage balances. Few lenders will let you borrow against more
          than 85% of your home’s value, either with a cash-out refinancing or
          with your existing mortgage plus a new home equity loan.
        </span>

        <span>
          But, if you’re eligible and have plenty of equity, home equity
          financing comes with some of the lowest interest rates available. And
          monthly payments are smaller because loan terms are longer than those
          of most personal loans.

              It’s expensive in the long run to borrow for a long time, even if

              As long as you have a loan against your account, you can’t

          Debt management plans from credit counseling firms
        </span>

        <span>
          Like other forms of debt consolidation, debt management plans don’t
          make your debts disappear. But they may ease your burden by reducing
          your monthly payments.
        </span>

        <span>
          You’ll work with a certified credit counselor who will look into your
          financial situation in depth. You’ll then get a customized plan, and
          your counselor may be able to negotiate lower interest rates
          (“concession rates”) with your creditors.
        </span>

        <span>
          You make one payment covering your enrolled debts each month into the
          plan, and it’s distributed among your creditors. The payment includes
          a fee that goes to the counseling firm. DMPs can work if you can
          afford the payment, and it gets you out from under your enrolled debts
          in a reasonable amount of time.
        </span>

        <span>
          However, the Federal Trade Commission says, “The traditional Debt
          Management Plan (DMP) supported by creditors is not sufficient to help
          many consumers…these inflexible full principal programs will work for
          only about 25 percent of consumers who seek credit counseling
          assistance because they require a payment beyond a consumer’s ability
          to manage over the life of a program.”
        </span>

        <span class="text-center font-semibold">
          If you enter a DMP, make sure you can afford it.

        <span>
          Debt consolidation can help pay off debt faster if you do it
          correctly. However, some mistakes can put you in a much worse

              Thinking that consolidation “wipes out” your debt – it certainly
              doesn’t. You’ve simply rearranged your financial deck chairs. Your

              Incurring balances while you still owe on your debt consolidation
              loan – it’s tough, but don’t build up more debt while you’re
              paying down your consolidation loan. Learn to live frugally, at
              least until you’re clear of unsecured debt.

          Arguably, the biggest mistake is waiting too long to act – If you’re
          in financial trouble, there’s a good chance your credit score is
          falling. And that’s going to badly affect the interest rate you’ll pay
          when you finally get around to consolidating. So act now!
